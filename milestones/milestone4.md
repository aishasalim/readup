## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

Everything went smoothly.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Adding Lists and list-items to the schema was super challenging.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

We closed 7 issues:

- BASELINE - Interactive Elements for Adding Reviews and Saving Books
- ADDITIONAL - Clipped Books for Custom Lists
- CUSTOM - Data Validation for User Inputs
- STRETCH - Button States During Form Submission
- CUSTOM - Error Handling for API and Form Submissions
- STRETCH - Toast Messages for User Actions
- BASELINE - Ability to Reset Database to Default State

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think these issues are at risk:

- ADDITIONAL - AI Recommendations for Users
- BASELINE - Deploy App on Railway

Since we are not 100% sure how they can be technically implemented. We need more time to implement these features, since we need more research.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

More time to research and debug.
